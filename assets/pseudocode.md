# Pseudocode for the Coding Quiz
This is the pseudocode that I have came up with to start creating
my script for the Coding Quiz.

## Questions.js pseudocode
1. Get elements for question area (questions + choices)

2. Object + Array for all questions and choices + right answer
- Properties for question object include
-> Question
-> Array of answer choices
-> Index for the correct answer in the choices array

3. Function for shuffling questions
4. Copy of questions array
5. Shuffling syntax to reorder the copy (for loop)

6. Shuffle questions array 

7. Export/Run function of question objects
